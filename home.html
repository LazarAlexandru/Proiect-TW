            <p> Compass is a knowledgeable and active participant in the rare coin and currency field. We’ve been
                involved in collecting and trading in coins and paper money for many years, and have the necessary
                expertise to evaluate numismatic material in a wide variety of fields. In areas where our expertise is
                not as strong, we associate with partners across the country who help us to identify and evaluate the
                more obscure material. The growth of online resources, and the extraordinary capabilities of digital
                photography have taken much of the guesswork and mystery out of pricing numismatic material.
